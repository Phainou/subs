02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:06,080
## said you know shut the [ __ ] up like stfu in 
## a comment i personally saw that myself at one  
ha scritto "chiudi quella [ __ ] di bocca" in 
un commento. L'ho visto con i miei occhi a un 



1187
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:10,160
## point and i was like who the [ __ ] said that you 
## know that was quite a surprise for me to see um  
certo punto, e ho pensato: "chi [ __ ] l'ha scritto". 
Sapete, è stata una sorpresa per me vedere... 



1188
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,800
## you know is this something that you guys stand 
## behind are you are you okay with like you know  
è qualcosa che voi appoggiate, 
vi sta bene che 



1189
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,640
## going out and telling people like if they're being 
## you know if they're acting silly or if they're  
si vada a dire alle persone se si stanno 
comportando da stupidi 



1190
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:23,440
## being silly is that is that with your social media 
## team are they like you know go and do that or was  
il vostro team dei social media 
incoraggia questo comportamento o si trattava 



1191
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:27,840
## this some bad actors in the team that are now 
## not doing that you know how has that changed i  
di qualche piantagrane del team che adesso 
non lo fa più.



1192
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,640
## haven't seen it since you know it seems like when 
## the whole thing happened with george um it seemed  




1193
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:38,320
## after that that social media has been direct and 
## but there's not been any of this like shut up and  




1194
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:43,920
## you know and the rude comments seem to have almost 
## stopped so it was am i right in assuming that  




1195
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,960
## that was linked or or is this something you've 
## changed inside internally and now it's different  




1196
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,640
## well it's not good it's not it's it's not 
## the george it's not that george was just  




1197
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:04,400
## cursing people out using our account um i think we 
## need to see like specific examples of where this  




1198
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:12,800
## has happened for us to comment more specifically 
## about those things but generally we don't just  




1199
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:19,600
## curse people out no we don't but we do speak 
## in a real way and so sometimes you might see  




1200
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:26,080
## us calling someone a dick because they're acting 
## like a dick and it's and it won't be without us  




1201
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:32,560
## communicating effectively you know we're not 
## just calling them a dick and if you if you just  




1202
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,200
## don't be a dick yourself and just conclude it that 
## way when you know there's more context involved  




1203
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:45,280
## here if you read the entire comment usually you 
## can see us responding with an educated a response  




1204
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:51,440
## that educates the viewer that the reader and 
## we're not just telling them to [ __ ] off or  




1205
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:56,080
## to shut the [ __ ] up or whatever it is you know 
## that's not that's not what we do we're we're out  




1206
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:01,360
## to edify people hold them accountable when you 
## hold people accountable sometimes you have to  




1207
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:06,480
## be real with them and you have to pull them out 
## and say you're being a dick when they're being do  




1208
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:16,000
## sure and and um this links in with the the 
## the vegetarian drama let's let's call it  




1209
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,800
## so this is something that av does focus on quite 
## a lot and nasal i know you actually made a posted  




1210
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,080
## a video on this relatively recently about 
## about uh vegetarians um that's a that's a  




1211
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,720
## another big criticism that the criticism 
## being that av is av attacks vegetarians  




1212
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:35,920
## that's the criticism like that that's come up a 
## lot actually and i've seen that not only in my own  




1213
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,520
## you know me asking people for questions 
## but also when you're just scrolling and  




1214
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,880
## if you're in reddit or something like that one 
## of the common things that comes up is like av  




1215
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:47,440
## is counterproductive because they attack 
## vegetarians um i think i already know how  




1216
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:51,840
## you're gonna answer this but um maybe it's a 
## bit of an easier one to deal with what do you  




1217
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,600
## respond to these people who get upset about 
## that and say you're attacking vegetarians




1218
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,720
## which vegetarian we've never 
## targeted a specific vegetarian  




1219
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:09,840
## we attack vegetarianism and i think 
## that vegetarianism is the single  




1220
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,840
## greatest cancer in the animal rights 
## movement other than vegans themselves




1221
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,280
## being number one actually vegans vegans are number 
## one the number one threat to the animal rights  




1222
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:29,600
## movement uh vegetarians are operating in society 
## under this idea this image of being on the side  




1223
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:35,120
## of the animals to be there they're portraying 
## themselves as animal people quote unquote right  




1224
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:43,120
## and whenever they speak to vegans generally 
## speaking of course majority of these individuals  




1225
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:48,400
## are pompous and they tell you that you don't 
## need to talk to them because they're already  




1226
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:54,480
## vegetarian is the way that they would frame 
## it i'm already vegetarian so these people  




1227
02:03:55,120 --> 02:04:00,240
## on paper in terms of the facts are 
## doing exactly as much as someone whose  




1228
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:04,880
## paleo is doing for the animals because they 
## don't consume dairy vegetarians don't consume  




1229
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:13,200
## flesh dairy is considered more cruel to cows than 
## eating their flesh is the dairy industry we as  




1230
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:19,440
## animal rights activists tend to say this stuff so 
## it's not just me saying that so if that's the case  




1231
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:28,240
## paleo people are more in alignment with us than 
## vegetarians are but that logic is flawed so  




1232
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:37,520
## it's insane that they would get a pass for being 
## portrayed as animal people and as long as they  




1233
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:44,880
## continue to parade and act like they are animal 
## people the longer it will take to get vegetarians  




1234
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:51,840
## to become vegan and the more we make a mockery of 
## the real animal rights message for everybody else  




1235
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:59,920
## and the longer the vegans cuddle vegetarians 
## and again i'm not talking about any specific  




1236
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,840
## vegetarian talking about vegetarianism 
## the longer we cuddle vegetarianism
